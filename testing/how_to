how to use this app:
    1. make sure all your results are in a folder one dir down from your working dir
        ex. tradingproject/testing/ is your working folder, this is where your import file is.
            results should be in a folder here tradingproject/results/

    2. open a python terminal

        b. run this: z = import_results('PATH TO RESULTS DIR')
        c. run this: run convert_to_dataframe_v2.py
        d. run this: event_names = convert_to_dataframe(z)
