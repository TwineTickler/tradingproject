git:
	- remember credentials on a machine, run the line:
		git config --global credential.helper store
	- reset ALL local changes
		get reset --hard

regression:

Independant variable: X axis
Dependant variable: Y axis
    - outcome?
    - dependant on the other variable

It seems that X is going to be time. Y would be everything else, price, volume, etc

Might need to use multiple regression because of each of the Y values.

Logistic Regression predicts something either True or False instead of something continuous.
    - Typically used for classification
    - Possible someting like:
        - Price will increase by 100 based on: Price, Volume, Time
        - Price will not increase by 100 based on: Price, Volume, Time
    - Need to research *Maximum Likelyhood*

Stepwise Regression might be a better choice
    - best when we deal with multiple independant variables

Supervised learning (labling your data)
Unsupervised learning (not sure what you are looking for in your data)

Supervised Learning + Discrete = classification or categorization
Supervised Learning + Continuous = Regression
Unsupervised Learning + Discrete = Clustering
Unsupervised Learning + Continuous = Dimensionality Reduction

ARIMA - used for predicting futuristic time-related predictions
LSTM - (Long Short Term Memory), great for retianing long term memory

Neural Networks:
    - feed-forward
    - recurrent
    - convolutional
    - modular

TODO:
	- make sure I can iterate through each of the dictionaries (and get their dictionary names) of the dics in the file
